      <description>&lt;p&gt;Until recently I worked with a particularly difficult engineer. He&#xA;fits the sterotype of Silicon Valley psychopath that sees the people&#xA;around them as disposeable tools to achieve his goals. This person was&#xA;(and is) very smart, and was one of the early adopters of AI in my&#xA;environment. Eventually that got him an internal transfer to another&#xA;more AI-centric position and sailed into the sunset.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
