      <description>&lt;p&gt;Until recently I worked with a particularly difficult engineer. He&#xA;fits the sterotype of Silicon Valley psychopath that sees the people&#xA;around them as disposeable tools to achieve his goals. This person was&#xA;(and is) very smart, and was one of the early adopters of AI in my&#xA;environment. Eventually that got him an internal transfer to another&#xA;more AI-centric position and sailed into the sunset.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The first months after you start exercising you improve regardless of how&#xA;efficiently you train, just because doing &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt; is better than&#xA;doing &lt;em&gt;nothing&lt;/em&gt;. These are called &lt;strong&gt;newbie gains&lt;/strong&gt; and they are everywhere:&#xA;we are bound to make rapid progres at pretty much almost anything that&#xA;we start learning deliberately, at least in the beginning. But what&#xA;happens after the newbie gains are over? You need a method. And if you&#xA;are an adult leading a busy life and wanting to dig deep into a new&#xA;pursuit, that method better be good.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
