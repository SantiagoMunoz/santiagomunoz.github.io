AI will teach us to be better humans
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-4" class="outline-text-3">
<p>
Until recently I worked with a particularly difficult engineer. He
fits the sterotype of Silicon Valley psychopath that sees the people
around them as disposeable tools to achieve his goals. This person was
(and is) very smart, and was one of the early adopters of AI in my
environment. Eventually that got him an internal transfer to another
more AI-centric position and sailed into the sunset.</p>
<p>
I noticed something rather spectacular when he later on came back to
my division to give a talk about how to use one of the AI tools that
was  building… the same person that, until less than a year ago was
shipping his (perfectly capable and fine) juniors off to die on
impossible projects with no guidance or instuction and then offloading
blame on them for arbitrary thing that were clearly above their pay
grade was now <em>advocating for empathy, patience and understanding
towards the agents</em>.</p>
<p>
That talk awoke something in me, which has led to the realization that
many of the best practices to use AI agents translates very well to
working with humans, in many cases by only replacing &#34;agent&#34; with
&#34;person&#34;. Here are some examples from my own experience so far:</p>
<ul>
<li>Agents have a limited contexts which needs to be managed with care…
just like us: there is only so much information a person can hold in
their brain at any given time. With agents, we reason about the
value of keeping the context tailored to the task at hand to avoid
attention dillution and prevent it from mixing two concepts that
should not be mixed. Oh my, I wonder where I have seen that before!</li>
<li>We provide agents with <em>skills</em>, documented runbooks describing how to perform
specific tasks so that they can perform better. How many projects
have I been through where all the original developers were gone and
I wish there was some documentation <em>at all?</em></li>
<li>Agents perform better when they receive clear instruction and
explanations of what they need to do. Just like my junior
colleagues! Same goes for checking on how they are doing and
interrupting the process to course correct when they go off-track.</li>
<li>Complex tasks are better split into smaller sub-tasks that are
shipped of to specialized sub-agents with their own context. This
results in bigger overall context for the task, and bigger
performance since each instance has tailored context (see first point).
Is this not analogous to the concept of <em>division of labour</em>?
<em>Serializing work instead of multitasking</em>? <em>Teamwork</em>?</li>
</ul>
<p>To some degree, I am even surprised that anyone would consider any of
these &#34;novel&#34; thinking. And if I allow myself to indulge in cynism for
a second, maybe we are all a bit like my colleague that /we are willing
to adapt to the needs of the machine and not the needs of each
other/.</p>
<p>
Who knows, perhaps a positive side effect of this AI revolution is
that we improve our understanding of ourselves and learn how to
interact with each other better. It is definitely helping me be a
better techlead and affecting how I run my team already.</p>

How I structure my learning
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-5" class="outline-text-3">
<p>
The first months after you start exercising you improve regardless of how
efficiently you train, just because doing <em>anything</em> is better than
doing <em>nothing</em>. These are called <strong>newbie gains</strong> and they are everywhere:
we are bound to make rapid progres at pretty much almost anything that
we start learning deliberately, at least in the beginning. But what
happens after the newbie gains are over? You need a method. And if you
are an adult leading a busy life and wanting to dig deep into a new
pursuit, that method better be good.</p>
<p>
When I entered the workforce I discovered that I could not longer fit my
art training and other interests within the comfortable boundaries of
a weekly schedule that I was used to as a student. I find that my
time/energy budget becomes more irregular and dependent on factors
outside of my control the more responsibilities I acquire over time,
and the trend will likely continue.</p>
<p>
I think this is a very common problem for a lot of people, and a
reason why new years resolutions are not very long lived: they are too
rigid for the variable energy profile of adulthood.</p>
<div id="outline-container-headline-6" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="headline-6">
Do what you can, with what you have
</h4>
<div id="outline-text-headline-6" class="outline-text-4">
<p>
If I cannot control my <strong>cadence</strong> as much, measuring my success around
would be disheartening. So I decided to try an alternative: <strong>focus on
proportion</strong>. I will indulge on another gym analogy for this: you do not
get very far if you only train the left arm and forget about the rest
of the body.</p>
<p>
Following learnings the world of exercise, I switched to trying
keeping balance across my activities and building cadence only as a
secondary concern. I ditched my schedule, defined what a <strong>training
cycle</strong> would look like and focused on completing <strong>reps</strong> in whatever time
I had available each week, tracking how many I could go through per month.</p>
<p>
As an example, in the days of learning to draw and paint the human
figure this is what a typical cycle looked like for me:</p>
<ul>
<li>3 pages of quick sketches</li>
<li>1 fully rendered drawing</li>
<li>1 page of drawing from imagination</li>
<li>1 page of gouache sketches copying artists I admire</li>
<li>1 page of drawings copying artists I admire</li>
</ul>
<p>I follow this strategy for art and many other pursuits: I set a theme,
build a list of activities (rest is also an activity), set the proportions,
define metrics and off I go! Every few cycles I reasses and adjust.</p>
<p>
Sometimes cycles take a few days, while others  take almost a month,
depending on how crazy work and life is. But I never feel bad about
it, because I can always look at my data I see I am investing in
myself consistently over time. The needle is <strong>always moving</strong>.</p>
<p>
With this mentality shift I find that I make steady progress in a
balanced way in whatever pursuit I am focusing, and get less
frustrated when a particular week does not go my way.</p>
