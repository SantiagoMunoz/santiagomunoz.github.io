Your coworkers are (probably) not idiots
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-4" class="outline-text-3">
<p>
One of the most common water cooler conversations I overhear at the
workplace is a variation of labeling someone as an idiot. Idiots from
the past or the present, sometimes even the idiots to come! This
puzzles me, because the majority of people I have worked with
have been at least competent. So where are all the idiots I keep hearing about?</p>
<div id="outline-container-headline-5" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="headline-5">
Everyone is an idiot to someone else
</h4>
<div id="outline-text-headline-5" class="outline-text-4">
<p>
It is impossible that all the people working on a project have exactly
the same upbringing and world view. I think the idiot label is issued
in many cases as a result of a mismanaged misunderstanding.</p>
<p>
The antidote here seems to be empathy. There is almost always a
logical explanation for idiotic behaviour we see around us. We may not
agree with it, but that does not mean it is not there.</p>
<p>
Understanding it allows us to make better decisions. Much of the good
work I have been able to do through my career has come precisely from
putting in the effort to understand the people that will benefit from
me doing it, so I say it is worth the effort.</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-headline-6" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="headline-6">
Taking history into account
</h4>
<div id="outline-text-headline-6" class="outline-text-4">
<p>
We tend to judge people by the code they write, but ignore the
circumstances in which it was written. Requirement changes, crushing
deadlines and understaffing are all terms any engineer is familiar
with, with software not being the exception.</p>
<p>
How many changes a system can withstand before it start cracking and
turning into a mess is, in my eyes, a true metric of skill and
seniority of the engineers that make it. Given enough pressure though,
everything gives in.</p>
<p>
So there is a lot to learn from the shape of a system, and when we
dismiss the whole thing as &#34;garbage made by an idiot&#34; we are giving up
valuable information about the environment where it was produced.</p>
<p>
This is true for non-software as well. Teams and organizations are
also systems designed and built by humans like you and me.</p>

Conclusion
</h4>
<div id="outline-text-headline-7" class="outline-text-4">
<p>
Idiots exist, but they are rarer than more circumstantial than the
mythos we Ainvent around them.</p>
<p>
I will take the risk and attempt a moderate definition based on my own
empirical evidence. &#34;<em>An idiot is a person that is unable or unwilling to
adapt to <strong>reasonable</strong> change in their environment</em>&#34; (and I won&#39;t even
dare define what reasonable is).</p>
<p>
There you go. Now make sure the idiot is not actually <strong>you</strong>.</p>

Be a finisher
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-8" class="outline-text-3">
<p>
Starting is easy, anyone can do it! Open your editor, write a couple
of lines and you have started a project. Read the first few pages and
you have started a book. Sign up to the gym and you have started your
journey to get fit. Now that technology is lowering the barrier of
entry to many things, starting has never been easier… and more
meaningless.</p>
<div id="outline-container-headline-9" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="headline-9">
Beginning is a drug
</h4>
<div id="outline-text-headline-9" class="outline-text-4">
<p>
But after a while, things start to get tough. Your project grows
and you start to encounter roadblocks. The book is not that
interesting anymore. And your waistline is not decreaing because you
actually have to… you know, go to the gym <em>regularly</em>.</p>
<p>
When the resistance comes it is easy to get lured into starting
something else. Get another high… &#34;This time it will be different!&#34;.
We tell ourselves (and sometimes others) a lie that we are making an
investment that will pay off <em>in the future</em>.</p>
<p>
And nothing is really ever achieved.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-headline-10" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="headline-10">
&#34;Continuing&#34; is just as bad
</h4>
<div id="outline-text-headline-10" class="outline-text-4">
<p>
Then there is the trap of <strong>mistaking motion for progress</strong> and convincing
ourselves that we are doing well because we are putting in
effort. Inching our way to an abstract ideal that will
come… <em>someday</em>.</p>
<p>
What is happening really is that we procrastinating on defining a
goal. Possibly to protect us from failure.</p>
<p>
And nothing is really ever achieved.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-headline-11" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="headline-11">
The value of being a finisher
</h4>
<div id="outline-text-headline-11" class="outline-text-4">
<p>
Being able to finish things is a valuable skill that requires
deliberate training. It wont happen unless you practice it. Very few
people can do it consistently.</p>
<p>
It is also a skill very much in demand. If you work in software just
look around you: there is a lot of software out there
already… waiting to be finished, or at least reshaped to adapt to
the environment it works (aka specifications changes). I would make
the argument that in many cases we don&#39;t actually need <em>more</em> software:
we need <em>better</em> software!</p>
<p>
In a world obsessed with empty starts and perpetual grinds, set
yourself apart by becoming a finisher!</p>

Energy is the currency of the universe
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-12" class="outline-text-3">
<p>
Our currencies used to be backed up by gold, a finite (and scarce)
resource. Because the supply of gold would not fluctuate much over
time, this meant that one could move value across time with <em>relative</em>
ease. What a nice property, right? What if we could think those terms
again?</p>
<div id="outline-container-headline-13" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="headline-13">
Energy as a unit of &#34;value&#34;
</h4>
<div id="outline-text-headline-13" class="outline-text-4">
<p>
Energy has a few nice things. For starters, the supply is finite. The
law of conservation of energy prevents us from disrupting valuations
by &#34;inventing&#34; new energy. Hello sweet stability!</p>
<p>
I also satisfies the broadest definition that we can come up for
&#34;value&#34;… because it is needed for <strong>everything</strong> that involves life. In
this sense, energy does better than gold, which is just a token with
little inherent value of its own.</p>
<div id="outline-container-headline-14" class="outline-5">
<h5 id="headline-14">
The drawback
</h5>
<div id="outline-text-headline-14" class="outline-text-5">
<p>
A problem with energy, however, is that it cannot be easily tokenized
for general-purpose trade across time: energy storage is a notoriously
complicated problem.</p>
<p>
However, I am not convinced this is an absolutely bad thing. Perhaps
there is value to limiting the amount of time one should be able to
move &#34;value&#34; across? A finite amount of energy always has to map to a
finite amount of goods, but the finite amount of goods useful to us
can fluctuate over time.</p>
</div>
</div>

</div>
<div id="outline-container-headline-15" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="headline-15">
What is this useful for?
</h4>
<div id="outline-text-headline-15" class="outline-text-4">
<p>
We are clearly not going to have &#34;energy coins&#34; and price bread in
Joules anytime soon. But perhaps we can take inspiration?</p>
<p>
I can think some very crazy ideas, such as <strong>a version of money that
expires unless you use it</strong> (yikes!?) to mitigate cross-generational imbalances.</p>
<p>
But on a more practical level, thinking in terms of energy helps me
undo <em>some</em> of my money-induced tunnel vision. After all, there are
things that money cant buy, and even when it can… sometimes it does
not track life value very well.</p>

AI will teach us to be better humans
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-16" class="outline-text-3">
<p>
Until recently I worked with a particularly difficult TL. He fitted
the sterotype of Silicon Valley psychopath that sees the people around
them as disposeable tools to achieve his goals. This person was (and
is) very smart, and was one of the early adopters of AI in my
environment. Eventually that got him an internal transfer to another
more AI-centric position so he moved on… and came back changed.</p>
<p>
Some months after, he came back to my division to give a talk about
one of the tools he was building. The tranformation was visible from
the first minute… the same person that, until less than a year ago was
throwing his (perfectly capable and fine) juniors and collaborators
under the bus for arbitraty thing that were clearly above their pay
grade was now <em>advocating for empathy, patience and understanding
towards the agents</em>.</p>
<p>
That talk awoke something in me, which has led to the realization that
many of the best practices to use AI agents translates very well to
working with humans, in many cases by only replacing &#34;agent&#34; with
&#34;person&#34;. Here are some examples from my own experience so far:</p>
<ul>
<li>Agents have a limited contexts which needs to be managed with care…
just like us: there is only so much information a person can hold in
their brain at any given time. With agents, we reason about the
value of keeping the context tailored to the task at hand to avoid
attention dillution and prevent it from mixing two concepts that
should not be mixed. Oh my, I wonder where I have seen that before!</li>
<li>We provide agents with <em>skills</em>, documented runbooks describing how to perform
specific tasks so that they can perform better. How many projects
have I been through where all the original developers were gone and
I wish there was some documentation <em>at all?</em></li>
<li>Agents perform better when they receive clear instruction and
explanations of what they need to do. Just like my junior
colleagues! Same goes for checking on how they are doing and
interrupting the process to course correct when they go off-track.</li>
<li>Complex tasks are better split into smaller sub-tasks that are
shipped of to specialized sub-agents with their own context. This
results in bigger overall context for the task, and bigger
performance since each instance has tailored context (see first point).
Is this not analogous to the concept of <em>division of labour</em>?
<em>Serializing work instead of multitasking</em>? <em>Teamwork</em>?</li>
</ul>
<p>To some degree, I am even surprised that anyone would consider any of
these &#34;novel&#34; thinking. And if I allow myself to indulge in cynism for
a second, maybe we are all a bit like my colleague that /we are willing
to adapt to the needs of the machine and not the needs of each
other/.</p>
<p>
Who knows, perhaps a positive side effect of this AI revolution is
that we improve our understanding of ourselves and learn how to
interact with each other better. It is definitely helping me be a
better techlead and affecting how I run my team already.</p>

How I structure my learning
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-17" class="outline-text-3">
<p>
The first months after you start exercising you improve regardless of how
efficiently you train, just because doing <em>anything</em> is better than
doing <em>nothing</em>. These are called <strong>newbie gains</strong> and they are everywhere:
we are bound to make rapid progres at pretty much almost anything that
we start learning deliberately, at least in the beginning. But what
happens after the newbie gains are over? You need a method. And if you
are an adult leading a busy life and wanting to dig deep into a new
pursuit, that method better be good.</p>
<p>
When I entered the workforce I discovered that I could not longer fit my
art training and other interests within the comfortable boundaries of
a weekly schedule that I was used to as a student. I find that my
time/energy budget becomes more irregular and dependent on factors
outside of my control the more responsibilities I acquire over time,
and the trend will likely continue.</p>
<p>
I think this is a very common problem for a lot of people, and a
reason why new years resolutions are not very long lived: they are too
rigid for the variable energy profile of adulthood.</p>
<div id="outline-container-headline-18" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="headline-18">
Do what you can, with what you have
</h4>
<div id="outline-text-headline-18" class="outline-text-4">
<p>
If I cannot control my <strong>cadence</strong> as much, measuring my success around
would be disheartening. So I decided to try an alternative: <strong>focus on
proportion</strong>. I will indulge on another gym analogy for this: you do not
get very far if you only train the left arm and forget about the rest
of the body.</p>
<p>
Following learnings the world of exercise, I switched to trying
keeping balance across my activities and building cadence only as a
secondary concern. I ditched my schedule, defined what a <strong>training
cycle</strong> would look like and focused on completing <strong>reps</strong> in whatever time
I had available each week, tracking how many I could go through per month.</p>
<p>
As an example, in the days of learning to draw and paint the human
figure this is what a typical cycle looked like for me:</p>
<ul>
<li>3 pages of quick sketches</li>
<li>1 fully rendered drawing</li>
<li>1 page of drawing from imagination</li>
<li>1 page of gouache sketches copying artists I admire</li>
<li>1 page of drawings copying artists I admire</li>
</ul>
<p>I follow this strategy for art and many other pursuits: I set a theme,
build a list of activities (rest is also an activity), set the proportions,
define metrics and off I go! Every few cycles I reasses and adjust.</p>
<p>
Sometimes cycles take a few days, while others  take almost a month,
depending on how crazy work and life is. But I never feel bad about
it, because I can always look at my data I see I am investing in
myself consistently over time. The needle is <strong>always moving</strong>.</p>
<p>
With this mentality shift I find that I make steady progress in a
balanced way in whatever pursuit I am focusing, and get less
frustrated when a particular week does not go my way.</p>
