  <div class="post-content"><div>
        <p>The first months after you start exercising you improve regardless of how
efficiently you train, just because doing <em>anything</em> is better than
doing <em>nothing</em>. These are called <strong>newbie gains</strong> and they are everywhere:
we are bound to make rapid progres at pretty much almost anything that
we start learning deliberately, at least in the beginning. But what
happens after the newbie gains are over? You need a method. And if you
are an adult leading a busy life and wanting to dig deep into a new
pursuit, that method better be good.</p>
<p>When I entered the workforce I discovered that I could not longer fit my
art training and other interests within the comfortable boundaries of
a weekly schedule that I was used to as a student. I find that my
time/energy budget becomes more irregular and dependent on factors
outside of my control the more responsibilities I acquire over time,
and the trend will likely continue.</p>
<p>I think this is a very common problem for a lot of people, and a
reason why new years resolutions are not very long lived: they are too
rigid for the variable energy profile of adulthood.</p>
<h2 id="do-what-you-can-with-what-you-have">Do what you can, with what you have<a href="#do-what-you-can-with-what-you-have" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">#</a> </h2>
<p>If I cannot control my <strong>cadence</strong> as much, measuring my success around
would be disheartening. So I decided to try an alternative: <strong>focus on
proportion</strong>. I will indulge on another gym analogy for this: you do not
get very far if you only train the left arm and forget about the rest
of the body.</p>
<p>Following learnings the world of exercise, I switched to trying
keeping balance across my activities and building cadence only as a
secondary concern. I ditched my schedule, defined what a <strong>training
cycle</strong> would look like and focused on completing <strong>reps</strong> in whatever time
I had available each week, tracking how many I could go through per month.</p>
<p>As an example, in the days of learning to draw and paint the human
figure this is what a typical cycle looked like for me:</p>
<ul>
<li>3 pages of quick sketches</li>
<li>1 fully rendered drawing</li>
<li>1 page of drawing from imagination</li>
<li>1 page of gouache sketches copying artists I admire</li>
<li>1 page of drawings copying artists I admire</li>
</ul>
<p>I follow this strategy for art and many other pursuits: I set a theme,
build a list of activities (rest is also an activity), set the proportions,
define metrics and off I go! Every few cycles I reasses and adjust.</p>
<p>Sometimes cycles take a few days, while others  take almost a month,
depending on how crazy work and life is. But I never feel bad about
it, because I can always look at my data I see I am investing in
myself consistently over time. The needle is <strong>always moving</strong>.</p>
<p>With this mentality shift I find that I make steady progress in a
balanced way in whatever pursuit I am focusing, and get less
frustrated when a particular week does not go my way.</p>
