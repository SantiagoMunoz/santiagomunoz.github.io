      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the most common water cooler conversations I overhear at the&#xA;workplace is a variation of labeling someone as an idiot. Idiots from&#xA;the past or the present, sometimes even the idiots to come! This&#xA;puzzles me, because the majority of people I have worked with&#xA;have been at least competent. So where are all the idiots I keep hearing about?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Be a finisher</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Starting is easy, anyone can do it! Open your editor, write a couple&#xA;of lines and you have started a project. Read the first few pages and&#xA;you have started a book. Sign up to the gym and you have started your&#xA;journey to get fit. Now that technology is lowering the barrier of&#xA;entry to many things, starting has never been easier&amp;hellip; and more&#xA;meaningless.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Energy is the currency of the universe</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Our currencies used to be backed up by gold, a finite (and scarce)&#xA;resource. Because the supply of gold would not fluctuate much over&#xA;time, this meant that one could move value across time with &lt;em&gt;relative&lt;/em&gt;&#xA;ease. What a nice property, right? What if we could think those terms&#xA;again?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>AI will teach us to be better humans</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Until recently I worked with a particularly difficult TL. He fitted&#xA;the sterotype of Silicon Valley psychopath that sees the people around&#xA;them as disposeable tools to achieve his goals. This person was (and&#xA;is) very smart, and was one of the early adopters of AI in my&#xA;environment. Eventually that got him an internal transfer to another&#xA;more AI-centric position so he moved on&amp;hellip; and came back changed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How I structure my learning</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The first months after you start exercising you improve regardless of how&#xA;efficiently you train, just because doing &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt; is better than&#xA;doing &lt;em&gt;nothing&lt;/em&gt;. These are called &lt;strong&gt;newbie gains&lt;/strong&gt; and they are everywhere:&#xA;we are bound to make rapid progres at pretty much almost anything that&#xA;we start learning deliberately, at least in the beginning. But what&#xA;happens after the newbie gains are over? You need a method. And if you&#xA;are an adult leading a busy life and wanting to dig deep into a new&#xA;pursuit, that method better be good.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
