  <div class="post-content"><div>
        <p>One of the most common water cooler conversations I overhear at the
workplace is a variation of labeling someone as an idiot. Idiots from
the past or the present, sometimes even the idiots to come! This
puzzles me, because the majority of people I have worked with
have been at least competent. So where are all the idiots I keep hearing about?</p>
<h2 id="everyone-is-an-idiot-to-someone-else">Everyone is an idiot to someone else<a href="#everyone-is-an-idiot-to-someone-else" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">#</a> </h2>
<p>It is impossible that all the people working on a project have exactly
the same upbringing and world view. I think the idiot label is issued
in many cases as a result of a mismanaged misunderstanding.</p>
<p>The antidote here seems to be empathy. There is almost always a
logical explanation for idiotic behaviour we see around us. We may not
agree with it, but that does not mean it is not there.</p>
<p>Understanding it allows us to make better decisions. Much of the good
work I have been able to do through my career has come precisely from
putting in the effort to understand the people that will benefit from
me doing it, so I say it is worth the effort.</p>
<h2 id="taking-history-into-account">Taking history into account<a href="#taking-history-into-account" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">#</a> </h2>
<p>We tend to judge people by the code they write, but ignore the
circumstances in which it was written. Requirement changes, crushing
deadlines and understaffing are all terms any engineer is familiar
with, with software not being the exception.</p>
<p>How many changes a system can withstand before it start cracking and
turning into a mess is, in my eyes, a true metric of skill and
seniority of the engineers that make it. Given enough pressure though,
everything gives in.</p>
<p>So there is a lot to learn from the shape of a system, and when we
dismiss the whole thing as &ldquo;garbage made by an idiot&rdquo; we are giving up
valuable information about the environment where it was produced.</p>
<p>This is true for non-software as well. Teams and organizations are
also systems designed and built by humans like you and me.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a href="#conclusion" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">#</a> </h2>
<p>Idiots exist, but they are rarer than more circumstantial than the
mythos we Ainvent around them.</p>
<p>I will take the risk and attempt a moderate definition based on my own
empirical evidence. &ldquo;<em>An idiot is a person that is unable or unwilling to
adapt to <strong>reasonable</strong> change in their environment</em>&rdquo; (and I won&rsquo;t even
dare define what reasonable is).</p>
<p>There you go. Now make sure the idiot is not actually <strong>you</strong>.</p>
