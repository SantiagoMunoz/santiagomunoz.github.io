  <div class="post-content"><div>
        <p>Until recently I worked with a particularly difficult TL. He fitted
the sterotype of Silicon Valley psychopath that sees the people around
them as disposeable tools to achieve his goals. This person was (and
is) very smart, and was one of the early adopters of AI in my
environment. Eventually that got him an internal transfer to another
more AI-centric position so he moved on&hellip; and came back changed.</p>
<p>Some months after, he came back to my division to give a talk about
one of the tools he was building. The tranformation was visible from
the first minute&hellip; the same person that, until less than a year ago was
throwing his (perfectly capable and fine) juniors and collaborators
under the bus for arbitraty thing that were clearly above their pay
grade was now <em>advocating for empathy, patience and understanding
towards the agents</em>.</p>
<p>That talk awoke something in me, which has led to the realization that
many of the best practices to use AI agents translates very well to
working with humans, in many cases by only replacing &ldquo;agent&rdquo; with
&ldquo;person&rdquo;. Here are some examples from my own experience so far:</p>
<ul>
<li>Agents have a limited contexts which needs to be managed with care&hellip;
just like us: there is only so much information a person can hold in
their brain at any given time. With agents, we reason about the
value of keeping the context tailored to the task at hand to avoid
attention dillution and prevent it from mixing two concepts that
should not be mixed. Oh my, I wonder where I have seen that before!</li>
<li>We provide agents with <em>skills</em>, documented runbooks describing how to perform
specific tasks so that they can perform better. How many projects
have I been through where all the original developers were gone and
I wish there was some documentation <em>at all?</em></li>
<li>Agents perform better when they receive clear instruction and
explanations of what they need to do. Just like my junior
colleagues! Same goes for checking on how they are doing and
interrupting the process to course correct when they go off-track.</li>
<li>Complex tasks are better split into smaller sub-tasks that are
shipped of to specialized sub-agents with their own context. This
results in bigger overall context for the task, and bigger
performance since each instance has tailored context (see first point).
Is this not analogous to the concept of <em>division of labour</em>?
<em>Serializing work instead of multitasking</em>? <em>Teamwork</em>?</li>
</ul>
<p>To some degree, I am even surprised that anyone would consider any of
these &ldquo;novel&rdquo; thinking. And if I allow myself to indulge in cynism for
a second, maybe we are all a bit like my colleague that <em>we are willing
to adapt to the needs of the machine and not the needs of each
other</em>.</p>
<p>Who knows, perhaps a positive side effect of this AI revolution is
that we improve our understanding of ourselves and learn how to
interact with each other better. It is definitely helping me be a
better techlead and affecting how I run my team already.</p>
